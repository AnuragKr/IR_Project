"abstract": "Avatar Sanskrit   avatra pronounced tar is a concept within Hinduism that in Sanskrit literally means descent It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity goddess or spirit on Earth The relative verb to alight to make one is appearance is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being The word avatar does not appear in the Vedic literature however it appears in developed forms in postVedic literature and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the th century CE Despite that the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism The Rigveda describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will The Bhagavad Gita expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than avatar Theologically the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu though the idea has been applied to other deities Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures including the ten Dashavatara of the Garuda Purana and the twentytwo avatars in the Bhagavata Purana though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology In the goddessbased Shaktism tradition of Hinduism avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari Durga and Kali are commonly found While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts this is minor and occasional The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism Incarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to avatar are also found in Buddhism Christianity and other religions The scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior"

exploration claiming that historical events like the moon landing were a political hoax and that scientific organizations such as NASA were shut down due to a belief that it was a waste of money and resources  Cooper ignores his daughter Murph when she claims a ghost is communicating to her through her bookshelf but later finds dust particles forming an inexplicable pattern on Murph is bedroom floor He investigates and is led to a secret government facility where Professor Brand explains that NASA was not actually shut down but rather has been secretly tasked by the government to explore the possibility of finding humanity a new home away from Earth Blight dust storms and failing crops have rendered humans incapable of surviving Brand claims to be working on a gravity equation to make this mission possible and asks Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft Cooper agrees promising a distraught Murph that he will return He pilots a shuttle carrying scientists Romilly Doyle and Brand s daughter Amelia to dock with the spacecraft Endurance The ship is headed towards a wormhole that mysteriously appeared near Saturn decades ago The Endurance passes through the wormhole into another galaxy with a planetary system orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua The crew intends to investigate three planets each previously explored by NASA volunteers who shared positive reports for habitability The first planet is an aqua planet with massive tidal waves and no dry land Doyle drowns after failing to get into the probe and getting knocked off by one of the waves and Amelia and Cooper fly back to the Endurance only to find that decades have passed due to the time slippage caused by the planet is proximity to Gargantua Romilly having remained onboard has aged  years Cooper replays messages from Earth learning that Murph is now his age and has become a scientist working with Brand The crew journeys to the second planet to find the previous NASA explorer Mann is still alive and has established a base On earth Murph learns from a dying Professor Brand that he gave up on solving his gravity equation years ago because it would take data from inside a black hole to reconcile which is impossible to achieve He reveals that he never intended for their mission to evacuate humanity from earth to succeed and was instead planning for Cooper and his fellow astronauts to try to establish their own colony and hopefully restart the human race themselves He dies and a distraught Murph relays this information to the crew As they explore the second planet they discover that Mann falsified the data in his reports so that the NASA mission would come rescue him Romilly is killed by Mann is booby trap when he tries to access the logs and Mann attempts to hijack the

his childhood being adopted and his current job as a journalist Kate is story is related to a traumatic event that happened when she was five years old where she witnessed a small boy murdered by her father This leads her to search for Andrew who she believes is a key to the mystery Kate believes that Andrew was the twin of the boy she witnessed die As the diaries are read the truth of the what

disrupts a fake seance being conducted by Angier and his wife after having conducted a previous one for one of Borden is relatives Borden was upset that they were presenting it as real when he realized it was in truth an illusion During a scuffle Angier is pregnant wife Julia is thrown to the ground resulting in a miscarriage The two men are mutually antagonistic for many years afterwards as they rise to become worldrenowned stage magicians with the feud affecting the later generations of their families to come specifically Kate and Andrew Borden develops a teleportation act called The Transported Man and later creates an improved version named The New Transported Man which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye without appearing to pass through the intervening space The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous magic acts to shame The reader learns that Alfred Borden is actually not one man but two identical twins named Albert and Frederick who share the identity of Alfred Borden secretly to ensure their professional success with The New Transported Man Angier suspects that Borden uses a double but dismisses the idea because he thinks it is too easy Angier desperately tries to equal Borden is success With the help of the acclaimed inventor Nikola Tesla Angier develops an act called In a Flash which produces a similar result through a starkly different method Tesla is device teleports a human being from one place to another by creating an exact physical duplicate at the required destination into which the person is consciousness is instantly transmitted thus leaving the original physical subject behind Because of this method Angier is forced to devise a way to conceal the original in order to preserve the illusion whenever the trick is performed He clinically refers to these nearlifeless shells in his diary as the prestiges Angier is new act is as successful as Borden is The infuriated and obsessed Borden attempts to discover how In a Flash is performed During one performance he breaks into the backstage area and turns off the power to Angier is device mistakenly believing the generator powering it is about to catch fire and turn the theatre ablaze The subsequent teleportation is incomplete and both the duplicated Angier and the prestige Angier survive as separate persons after this incident but the original feels increasingly weak physically while the duplicate seems to lack physical substance The original prestige Angier fakes his own death as part of a previous plan to put behind his public persona of a magician and returns as the heir to his family estate of Caldlow House without any publicity While there he becomes terminally ill Angier had discovered Borden is secret as a twin prior to the accident that created his duplicate Now alienated from the world by his ghostly form and consumed with thoughts of revenge the Angier duplicate attacks one of the twins before a performance However Borden is apparent poor health age and the duplicate Angier is resurgent sense of morality prevent the assault from becoming murder It is implied that this particular Borden twin dies a few days later and the incorporeal Angier travels to meet the corporeal Angier now living as the th Earl of Colderdale They come into possession of Borden is diary courtesy of a disgruntled third party in need of money but publish it without revealing the twins secret Shortly afterwards the corporeal Angier dies and his ghostly duplicate uses Tesla is device one last time to teleport himself into the body hoping that either he will reanimate it and become whole again or kill himself instantly and so reunite with his other self in death  In the final section of the novel Kate and Andrew is mystery is revealed Andrew Westley goes into the Angier family vault He finds all of Rupert Angier is nearlifeless shells the prestiges labelled with the date and place they were created Andrew also finds a prestige of a small boy with the label Nicholas Julius Borden with his place of creation listed as Caldlow House It is then understood that Andrew himself never had a twin The night Kate witnessed his death he had actually been cast into the Tesla device by Kate is father and had become a physical duplicate of himself It is also revealed to Kate Angier and Andrew Westley that in Caldlow House some form of Rupert Angier has continued to survive to the present day It appears Angier is attempt to become whole again was successful Angier confirms to Andrew in their brief moment of contact in the vault that Andrew was a physical duplicate of the small boy just like Angier was a duplicate of all the prestiges in the vault",

"abstract": "In Greek mythology Prometheus prmiis Ancient Greek  promtu s possibly meaning forethought is a Titan god of fire Prometheus is best known for defying the gods by stealing fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology knowledge and more generally civilization  In some versions of the myth he is also credited with the creation of humanity from clay Prometheus is known for his intelligence and for being a champion of humankind and is also generally seen as the author of the human arts and sciences He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion the hero of the flood story The punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft of fire and giving it to humans is a popular subject of both ancient and modern culture Zeus king of the Olympian gods sentenced Prometheus to eternal torment for his transgression Prometheus was bound to a rock and an eagle the emblem of Zeus was sent to eat his liver in ancient Greece the liver was thought to be the seat of human emotions His liver would then grow back overnight only to be eaten again the next day in an ongoing cycle According to several major versions of the myth most notably that of Hesiod Prometheus was eventually freed by the hero Heracles In yet more symbolism the struggle of Prometheus is located by some at Mount Elbrus or at Mount Kazbek two volcanic promontories in the Caucasus Mountains beyond which for the ancient Greeks lay the realm of the barbarii In another myth Prometheus establishes the form of animal sacrifice practiced in ancient Greek religion Evidence of a cult to Prometheus himself is not widespread He was a focus of religious activity mainly at Athens where he was linked to Athena and Hephaestus who were the Greek deities of creative skills and technology In the Western classical tradition Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving particularly the quest for scientific knowledge and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences In particular he was regarded in the Romantic era as embodying the lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence could also result in tragedy Mary Shelley for instance gave The Modern Prometheus as the subtitle to her novel Frankenstein"

"abstract": "In particle physics annihilation is the process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles such as an electron colliding with a positron to produce two photons The total energy and momentum of the initial pair are conserved in the process and distributed among a set of other particles in the final state Antiparticles have exactly opposite additive quantum numbers from particles so the sums of all quantum numbers of such an original pair are zero Hence any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are obeyed During a lowenergy annihilation photon production is favored since these particles have no mass Highenergy particle colliders produce annihilations where a wide variety of exotic heavy particles are created The word annihilation takes use informally for the interaction of two particles that are not mutual antiparticles    not charge conjugate Some quantum numbers may then not sum to zero in the initial state but conserve with the same totals in the final state An example is the annihilation of a highenergy electron antineutrino with an electron to produce a W boson If the annihilating particles are composite such as mesons or baryons then several different particles are typically produced in the final state"

Guide as he travels the world a decade after the end of what is most commonly referred to as the Zombie War The pandemic begins twenty years previously in the early st Century with the infection of a boy in a village in Dachang China the release of the virus referred to as Solanum in The Zombie Survival Guide is implied to have been caused by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam The Politburo initially covers up the outbreak by engineering a military crisis with Taiwan to avoid appearing weak internationally but thousands of infected quickly spread the virus outside of China through immigration human trafficking and the organ trade The virus spreads to Cape Town South Africa where the first major public outbreak occurs leading to the virus initially being dubbed African rabies A Mossad agent publishes a report detailing the undead threat and recommending countermeasures but Israel is the only country to take it seriously The United States in particular is overconfident and distracted by an upcoming election responding only by deploying small special operations teams to temporarily contain isolated outbreaks Israel meanwhile responds by enacting a policy of voluntary quarantine in which it ceases occupying the Palestinian territories evacuates Jerusalem and constructs a wall along the demarcation line established in  The government also offers asylum to any Palestinian living in the formerly occupied territories and any Palestinian whose family previously resided in Israel These policies spark a civil war by enraging the Israeli religious right though the uprising is eventually suppressed by the IDF Worldwide a widely marketed placebo vaccine named Phalanx creates a false sense of security This period later becomes known as the Great Denial The following spring an unnamed journalist reveals the uselessness of Phalanx and the truth of Solanum sparking a crisis later dubbed the Great Panic in which global order collapses with rioting breakdown of essential services and indiscriminate culling of citizens killing more people than the zombies themselves Russia forces a decimation of its military to end rampant mutinies Ukraine uses VX gas on refugees and its own citizens in an attempt to weed out the infected Iran and Pakistan destroy each other in a brief nuclear exchange over a refugee crisis When the US military stages a highprofile battle in Yonkers New York their conventional warfare tactics prove insufficient against the overwhelming horde of zombies and the military is routed on live television The catastrophe causes the US President to suffer a nervous breakdown resulting in the Vice President and his cabinet invoking Section  of the th Amendment and forcibly removing him from office The US government evacuates west of the Rocky Mountains and establishes a new capital in Honolulu Hawaii The ISS remains crewed by three astronauts who volunteer to not return to Earth its commander observes mileswide mega swarms of zombies stretching across Central Asia and the Great Plains The fallout from the Iran Pakistan War as well as the millions of global fires sparked by the crisis creates a nuclear winter Knowing that zombies freeze solid in extreme cold many illprepared North American civilians flee into the wilderness of northern Canada where an estimated eleven million people die of disease hypothermia starvation and cannibalism Paul Redeker a former intelligence consultant for the apartheidera South African government develops a drastic survival strategy that designates large groups of humans as unwitting bait distracting the undead to give safe zones time to fortify themselves and build up resources most countries go on to adopt the controversial plan Four years later during a United Nations conference held off the coast of Honolulu aboard the recommissioned USS Saratoga the United States declares its intention to go on the offensive against the undead inspiring other countries to follow suit Determined to lead by example the US military reinvents itself to more effectively combat zombies as without a vaccine every last one must be destroyed to end the pandemic automatic weapons and mechanized infantry are replaced by semiautomatic rifles and volley firing soldiers are retrained to target the head over the torso and maintain steady rates of fire and troops are equipped with body armor designed to protect from infection via zombie bites or bodily fluids The United Kingdom constructs fortified elevated motorways to enable easier travel throughout Great Britain while the hordes of undead are being cleared A new martial art known as Mkunga Lalem translating to the Eel and the Sword is invented specifically to fight zombies The contiguous United States is liberated three years after the Honolulu Conference and global victory is declared after another two years upon the liberation of China although the British Armed Forces do not fully liberate London until three years after

repopulation program under which the nation is few remaining fertile women are used as state broodmares North Korea remains quarantined as its entire population mysteriously vanished at the beginning

with many of these criminals surviving and going on to establish their own independent fiefdoms The overall quality of human life has diminished including shorter life expectancies limited access to running water and electricity and the resurgence of diseases like the Spanish flu Many animals notably whales have gone extinct due to overhunting pollution or being killed by the undead Fossil fuels
